          <li>
            Developing and testing a smart irrigation system that can monitor
            soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop growth and adjust water
            supply accordingly using sensors, actuators, and cloud computing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designing and building a robotic arm that can perform various tasks
            such as welding, painting, assembling, and inspecting using computer
            vision, machine learning, and haptic feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating and launching a nano-satellite that can collect and
            transmit data for scientific, commercial, or educational purposes
            using low-cost and lightweight components and a CubeSat standard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developing and implementing a biometric security system that can
            authenticate users based on their fingerprints, face, iris, or voice
            using image processing, pattern recognition, and encryption
            algorithms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designing and constructing a wind turbine that can generate clean
